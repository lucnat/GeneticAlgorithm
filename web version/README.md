Simple genetic algorithm
========================

This is a simple javascript OOP project which can serve as template for creating complex genetic algorithms.
To use it as a template for your own genetic algorithm, simply edit the individual class (Individual.js. Maybe you also want to change the population size, which you can do within the population class (Population.js).

The idea is then to visualize the genetic algorithm within a canvas window, as shown in this example:

In this plot, the red bars shows the genes of the individual fitting best to the green genes, which are the "solution" genes.
